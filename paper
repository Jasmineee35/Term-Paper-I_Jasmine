abstract: "COVID-19 has greatly impacted our society globally, as this disease spread around the globe, infecting all population. Some previous widespread viruses typically process certain infectious characteristics, such as male can be more likely to get infected compare to female, or children are more likely be infected etc. Thus, this research serves for the purpose to investigate whether COVID-19 has such characteristics, more specifically, the research will focus on the effects of Gender and Age. Note that this report used generative-AI tools for the purpose of data cleaning and graphical analysis."

# Introduction
COVID-19 changes our society in a lot of ways, study around this topic is essential as results can better improve the overall health and economic system for nations. Understanding some trends that this virus pocess may contribute the public health and vaccine development.  

The COVID-19 data retrieved from opendatatoronto provides a public record of individuals infected by the virous (tested positive). Analyzing some trends in this dataset in an statistical approach can possibly help the toronto public health system prepare for any further global coronavirus: determine effective prevention strategies, identifying high-risk populations, and provide insights to vaccine development. 

In the following paragraphs, I will first introduce the dataset then moving on to the initial statistic analysis of the data. First I will use two bar charts to see the overall distribution of the two main variables I want to study for: Age and Gender. Then, using another bar charts, it will indicate the COVID cases by both age and gender groups, showing the female and male distribution for each age interval side by side. Then moving on to the Severity Analysis Section (will include reference later), where additional analysis will be taken to study the specific impact of age to the severity of COVID infections. This particular section will offer insights to identify high-risk groups as well, preparing the toronto public health system. The final section (will add reference later) will touch on trends analysis to summarize COVID development with the passage of time. 

# COVID19 Data
To investigate the COVID infectious trends in Toronto, I retrieved the dataset "COVID19 cases.csv" from the Toronto Open Data Portal [@citedata]. This dataset contains 413474 observations and 15 variables. Among these 15 variables, this report will focus on four majour variables to conduct further analysis: age, gender, severity(ever_hospitalized), date. By using R [@citeR], and R packages "tidyverse" [@citetidyverse], "dplyr" [@citedplyr], "janitor" [@citejanitor], and "knitr" [@citeknitr], I cleaned the dataset by first checking whether there exists missing value, and then convert the date column name to ymd format, finally standardize the column names.

# Graphical Analysis
Having a foundation of what the dataset look-like, we will now come to the graphical analysis part. We will look at the direct distribution of the Age Group and Gender data using a bar chart. A bar chart can provide clear view on the total distribution of the data: mean, median, skewness, shape.

Bar Chart for Age Group Distribution
This graph will display the distribution of COVID-19 cases across different age groups.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Age.Group)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of COVID-19 Cases by Age Group",
       x = "Age Group",
       y = "Number of Cases") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) # Rotate x-axis labels so it does not squeeze on the x-axis

```

This graph will show the distribution of COVID-19 cases between different genders.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Bar Chart for Gender Distribution
ggplot(data, aes(x = Client.Gender)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of COVID-19 Cases by Gender",
       x = "Gender",
       y = "Number of Cases") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

This bar chart will show individuals' gender side by side within each age group interval. Analysing the graph, I found that female typically have more chance to get infected compare to male especially in middle age: 40-59 and old age: 80-90. Thus if the nation encounter another similar type of virus, the health system can implement provision strategy with a focus on middle and old age females. 
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Bar Chart for Age Group and Gender Distribution
ggplot(data, aes(x = Age.Group, fill = Client.Gender)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of COVID-19 Cases by Age Group and Gender",
       x = "Age Group",
       y = "Number of Cases") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

# Severity Analysis

Nowing the distribution of our dataset, we will now look at how will age group affect the severity of COVID infections. For this analysis, I assume that severity is based on hospitalization rates. Observing from the graph, older age group especially 70 to 79 and 80 to 89 generation are severely affected by Covid infections. They exhibit the most hospitalized rate. This aligns with the study (need to find a study and reference later) indicating older generations' immune system and somatic function are weaker than younger generations. 
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data$Severity <- ifelse(data$Ever.Hospitalized == "Yes", "Severe", "Mild")

# Bar Chart for Severity Analysis
ggplot(data, aes(x = Age.Group, fill = Severity)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "COVID-19 Case Severity by Age Group",
       x = "Age Group",
       y = "Number of Cases",
       fill = "Severity") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```
